2. n is the value of the input argument. As measured in the Python code, the runtime is 0.005785 seconds. Time complexity  is O(n).
3. I iterate through the array from 3 to n+1, so it would take O(n) time. Initially, I did recursion based on a recursive relationship, but that would take 2^n as there are two recursive function calls each time. Then, I optimize it to O(n) by iterating through the array and remembering the entire sequence up to n by keeping track of an array of sizes n. I then optimize space by only recognizing the previous two values by two variables or an array of size 2 (what I did in this case).
